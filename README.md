We will create a Telegram bot for the conversation with the ESP32-CAM;
When we send the message /photo to the ESP32-CAM bot, the ESP32-CAM board receives the message, takes a new photo, and sends it to the Telegram bot;
You can send the message /photoWithFlash to turn on ESP32-CAM’s LED flash and Lamp while capturing the photo;
You can activate/deactivate the PIR sensor by sending the message /motionOn or /motionOff, if the motion sensor is active, it will keep on sending photos, whenever it senses any motion;
You can control an AC lamp by sending the message /lightOn or /lightOff;
You can monitor the LIVE room temperature on the Telegram app by sending the message /weather;
You can send the /start message to receive a welcome message with all the commands to control the ESP32CAM;
The ESP32-CAM will only respond to messages coming from your Telegram account ID.
